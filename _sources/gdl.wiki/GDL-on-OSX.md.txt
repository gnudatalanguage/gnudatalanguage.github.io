# GDL on OSX
## packages

GDL is available from:
- Homebrew: https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-science/blob/master/Formula/gnudatalanguage.rb
- Macports: https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/math/gnudatalanguage
- Fink: http://finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/gdl

## compilation

We have various difficult points when compiling GDL from source : 
 - activating OpenMP. Depending of OSX version, default Clang may or not come with OpenMP. If OpenMP is not around, we need to deactivated it : 
```
cmake . [others flags] -DOPENMP=OFF
```

 - activating Readline. Editline is not fully compliant with Readline but it wrongly made symbolic links with readline headers files. Very dangerous. You must install a clean Readline lib. around (the one provided by Brew is OK) then cleanly link to it : 
```
cmake . [others flags] -DREADLINEDIR=/usr/local/opt/readline/
```
An example working (tested) on OSX 10.11, 10.12 & 10.14 (with Readline provided by Brew, and Cmake >= 3.0) : 

```
git clone https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl
cd gdl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DREADLINEDIR=/usr/local/opt/readline/ -DOPENMP=OFF -DWXWIDGETS=OFF
-DGEOTIFF=OFF  -DHDF=OFF  -DUDUNITS2=OFF -DPSLIB=OFF -DGRIB=off -DGLPK=OFF
make -j 4
make check  (few tests will fail)
```
