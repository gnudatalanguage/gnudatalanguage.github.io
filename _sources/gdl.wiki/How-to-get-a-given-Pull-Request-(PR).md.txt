# How to get a given Pull Request (PR)

If you wan to try a given Pull Request, you have to use a special syntax. Modern tool with simple syntax is available now (gh) but in Debian 10, it is not availalble : 

- the good old way :
Assuming the PR you want to test is number 9999 (for the name `pr9999` you can use want you want)
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/
cd gdl
git fetch https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl pull/9999/head:pr9999
git checkout pr9999
```

- the super simple syntax with `gh` https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/
gh pr list           # to have the list of pending PR
gh pr checkout 9999  # assuming PR 9999 is in the previous list
```
