# GDL on Linux
## packages:

- Fedora: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gdl actively maintained.
- Mageia: https://madb.mageia.org/package/show/application/0/arch/x86_64/name/gnudl 1.0rc3 Excellent!
- Debian: 
  - https://packages.debian.org/stable/gnudatalanguage 0.9.9 too OLD
  - https://packages.debian.org/python3-gdl idem
- Ubuntu:
  - http://packages.ubuntu.com/gnudatalanguage 0.9.9 too OLD
  - https://packages.ubuntu.com/python3-gdl idem
- Gentoo:
  - https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-lang/gdl a 1.0.0 is available! Yepee!
- Arch:
  - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnudatalanguage/ 0.9.9 too OLD

SO THESE VERSIONS ARE (MOSTLY) OBSOLETE. This warning will disappear when the above distributions will be in sync. 

At the moment, you can
-  download the unstable weekly build binaries from https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/releases/tag/weekly-release, also see [#957](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/pull/957)

*or*

 -  Download the gdl code, and run gdl/.ci/build_gdl.sh 2 times:
 - `build_gdl.sh prep` will install the required libraries.
 - `build_gdl.sh build` will build gdl in `build` and install it in `install`. This is the simplest way.

*or, traditional way*, using CMake etc:

- GDL is written in such a way you can compile it fully in user space, without being _root_, as long as all the mandatory packages (-dev/-devel) are around. If some packages are missing or outdated (e.g. Eigen3), yes, you can use a version in your user space, giving the path as a parameter to CMake (e.g. -DEIGEN3DIR=/path/to/local/Eigen3) 

- GDL can be compiled with : GCC (GNU C Compiler), Clang (LLVM), icc (Intel C compiler)

- GDL now requests CMake 3+. On some old systems (Debian 9, U 14.04) you have access to CMake 3+ with package cmake3 or equivalent module (on HPC with module) 


- You will **NEED the wxWidgets library and the plplot drivers for wxWidgets**
Eventually, you could build gdl with the option "-DINTERACTIVE_GRAPHICS=OFF' to enable compilation without warnings related to the absence of the adequate plplot driver, but GDL may be unable to open a graphic windows. Sometimes, plplot drivers for wxWindows or Xwin (X11) may be in a separate package, say, `plplot-driver-wxwidgets` . We appreciate returns to update this documentation.

- When compiling the first time, you may be blocked because one package is missing. After installing it, it is **mandatory** to clean the cache before running again cmake (`rm -f CMakeCache.txt`)

- Compilation. Once all the packages are around, it is quite fast on multicores :)

```
git clone https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl
cd gdl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j N  (N depending the number of cores you have)
make check
```
(on my old laptop with N=4, less than 5 minutes)
