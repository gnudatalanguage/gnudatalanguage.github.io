# ToDo list
Some details are still not fixed on GDL.

- adding testsuite to the packages

- maintaining up-to-date packaging on OSX.

- packaging on MSwin (how to download it ? how to use it)

- better managing of OpenMP on OSX (trying harder to detect & use it)
- robust detection of Readline files to avoid mixing with Editline (esp. on OSX)

- page by page HELP (as it is now available for HELP, /recall_com)
